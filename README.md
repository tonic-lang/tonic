# Tonic
A superset language of C++, designed specifically for fast-paced competitive programming. Tonic makes competing much faster to save those precious seconds, without sacrificing runtime speed.

Currently in early stages of development.

## Why Tonic?
- Significantly less verbose than C++, designed with simplcity and expressiveness in mind.
- Complete compatibility with C++, as Tonic allows you to use C++ components directly.
- More built-in algorithms and data-structures than the C++ standard library.
- Effective debugging and tracing of function calls.
- Compiling to readable C++ ensures Tonic can be used in competitions with C++ support.
- Goodbye, macros (mostly).
