# Tonic
A superset language of C++, designed specifically for fast-paced competitive programming. Tonic makes competing much faster to save those precious seconds, without sacrificing runtime speed.

Currently in (very) early stages of development.

## Why Tonic?
- Aims to be significantly less verbose than C++, geared towards competitions. That means lower macro usage than C++.
- Directly allows usage of C++ components.
- Low abstraction or overhead to keep runtime speed intact.
- Some competitive programming specific functionality including additional data structures, algorithms, tracing and debugging capabilities (in-progress).
- Since it compiles to C++ as a superset, the code can be directly used in competitions that support C++.
- Goodbye, macros (mostly).
