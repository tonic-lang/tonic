# Tonic
A superset language of C++, designed specifically for fast-paced competitive programming. Tonic makes competing much faster to save those precious seconds, without sacrificing runtime speed.

## Why Tonic?
- To make a highly specialized language to cater to competitive programming
- Significantly less verbose, and designed for coding speed in mind
- Fully compatible with C++ components, to ensure you have the right tools
- As fast as C++, as Tonic transpiles to C++ without abstracting too much
- Goodbye, macros (mostly)
